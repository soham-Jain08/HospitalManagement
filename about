Hospital Management System for Receptionist Use
Problem Statement:
The hospital previously maintained patient records in a physical register, which made it difficult to keep track of checked, emergency, and cancelled patients.
Additionally, payment transaction details were shared through a WhatsApp group using images, which were later verified manually.

Solution:
This project introduces a systematic approach by storing all patient and payment data in a structured database. This allows easy retrieval, updating, and deletion of records as needed. 
The system streamlines the receptionist’s workflow and improves data accuracy.

Project Components:
Backend:
Flask File: myapp.py

SQLite3 Database: hospital.db, which contains the following three tables:
                  1.User – Stores receptionist details including username and password.
                  2.Appointments – Stores patient appointment details such as type (checkup, follow-up, emergency), date, and status (checked, cancelled).
                  3.Payment – Stores payment details along with payment mode (cash, online, cheque).

Frontend (HTML + CSS in templates folder):
                  1.createLogin.html – Allows a receptionist to register by filling in personal details and creating a username and password.
                  2.login.html – Login page for receptionist access.
                  3.book.html – Used to add patient appointments by entering patient details, doctor's name, appointment date, and type (checkup, follow-up, emergency).

    Appointment Management Pages:
      These pages display patient data filtered by category and date. 
      They also support marking patients as checked or cancelled (for upcoming and emergency cases), and allow deleting records.

      Payments can be recorded through payment.html, and filtered or categorized by payment mode. Each page shows the total amount received and supports record deletion.

                  8.payment.html – Used to add payment details. It requests specific information based on the selected payment mode:
                                  Cash: No extra fields.
                                  Online: Requires transaction ID.
